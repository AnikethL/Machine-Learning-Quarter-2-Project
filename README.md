# Machine Learning Quarter 2 Project #

### Project Description

As many people lack the musical knowledge or skill to compose music, we are creating a piano song generation model trained on a dataset of 909 pop songs. This transformer-based model will focus on identifying correlations between songs and their attributes, including keys, notes, and chords; the model will apply these correlations to generate new accompaniment music. We will objectively evaluate our model by observing the set of notes generated by the model and matching them to scales/keys to see how musically “correct” the songs are. Additionally, we will evaluate the quality of the songs themselves by having a sample population knowledgeable in music evaluate the songs.
